Synchronize the closeout artifacts for the current ticket.

Required outputs:

- updated ticket status when appropriate through `ticket_update`
- fresh context snapshot through `context_snapshot`
- fresh START-HERE handoff through `handoff_publish`
- concise closeout summary

Rules:

- do not mark the ticket done before the required QA artifact exists
- keep the board and manifest as derived state, not manual editing targets
- when a canonical handoff artifact path is provided, write the full handoff body with `artifact_write` and then register it with `artifact_register`
- if a required artifact is missing, return a blocker instead of improvising closeout
