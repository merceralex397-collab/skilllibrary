# Repo Scaffold Factory

Use this skill when the goal is to create the initial repository operating system, not just a few starter files.

## Quick start

Run the bootstrap script when you want a full project skeleton:

```powershell
python scripts/bootstrap_repo_scaffold.py `
  --dest C:\path\to\repo `
  --project-name "Example Project"
```

Important flags:

- `--project-slug` to override the inferred slug
- `--agent-prefix` to override the inferred OpenCode agent prefix
- `--default-model` to change the default OpenCode agent model
- `--scope opencode` to generate only the OpenCode layer
- `--force` to overwrite an existing target tree

## What this skill generates

- Root `README.md`
- Root `AGENTS.md`
- Root `START-HERE.md`
- `docs/process/` and `docs/spec/`
- `tickets/` with manifest, board, and template
- `opencode.jsonc`
- `.opencode/agents/`, `.opencode/tools/`, `.opencode/plugins/`, `.opencode/commands/`, and `.opencode/skills/`

## Workflow

1. Normalize the source material first.
2. Decide the project name, slug, and default model string.
3. Run the scaffold bootstrap script.
4. Use `agent-prompt-engineering` if the repo needs custom team-leader, reviewer, or command prompts.
5. Review the generated docs and replace placeholders with project-specific facts.
6. Run `repo-process-doctor` in audit mode so prompt or ticket drift is caught before handoff.
7. Add stack-specific local skills after the repo stack is known.

This skill owns the scaffold template assets under `assets/project-template/`. Wrapper skills should call into this template rather than duplicating `.opencode`, ticket, or doc scaffolding logic elsewhere.
