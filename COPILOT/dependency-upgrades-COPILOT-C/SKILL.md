# Purpose
Execute dependency upgrades safely: distinguish security patches (merge fast) from feature upgrades (test carefully), review changelogs for breaking changes, ensure lockfiles stay pinned, and verify tests pass before merging. Dependabot automates detection; this skill handles the human judgment part.

# When to use this skill
Use when:
- Dependabot/Renovate PR needs review
- Security advisory requires immediate patching
- Major version upgrade planned (e.g., React 17→18)
- Lockfile conflicts need resolution

Do NOT use when:
- Full framework migration (use migration-pack-builder)
- Adding new dependencies (different workflow)
- Lockfile doesn't exist (create one first)

# Operating procedure
1. **Classify the upgrade type**:
   ```
   Security patch (CVSS ≥7): Merge within 24h after tests pass
   Security patch (CVSS <7): Merge within 1 week
   Patch version (x.y.Z):   Low risk, review changelog briefly
   Minor version (x.Y.z):   Medium risk, check for deprecations
   Major version (X.y.z):   High risk, full migration review needed
   ```

2. **Review changelog and release notes**:
   ```bash
   # For npm packages
   npm info <package> changelog
   # Or check GitHub releases page directly
   
   # Look for:
   # - BREAKING CHANGES section
   # - Deprecation notices
   # - Peer dependency changes
   # - Node/Python version requirements
   ```

3. **Check for peer dependency conflicts**:
   ```bash
   # npm
   npm ls <package>  # Check dependency tree
   npm outdated      # See all outdated packages
   
   # Python
   pip check         # Verify no broken requirements
   pipdeptree        # Visualize dependency tree
   ```

4. **Update lockfile correctly**:
   ```bash
   # npm - regenerate lockfile from package.json
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   
   # Python - use pip-compile for reproducibility
   pip-compile requirements.in --upgrade-package <package>
   
   # Cargo
   cargo update -p <package>
   ```

5. **Run full test suite**:
   ```bash
   # Don't just run unit tests - include integration/e2e
   npm test && npm run test:e2e
   
   # Check TypeScript still compiles
   npm run typecheck
   
   # Run linter to catch deprecation warnings
   npm run lint
   ```

6. **Verify runtime behavior** for significant upgrades:
   ```bash
   # Start dev server, click through critical paths
   npm run dev
   
   # Check bundle size didn't explode
   npm run build
   ls -la dist/
   ```

7. **Document upgrade in PR**:
   ```markdown
   ## Dependency Upgrade: [package] v1.2.3 → v2.0.0
   
   ### Changes
   - [Link to changelog]
   - Breaking: X method renamed to Y
   - Deprecation: Z will be removed in v3
   
   ### Verification
   - [x] Tests pass
   - [x] Typecheck passes
   - [x] No new lint warnings
   - [x] Manual smoke test of [feature]
   
   ### Migration Required
   - Updated calls to X → Y in src/utils.ts
   ```

# Output defaults
```markdown
## Dependency Upgrade Checklist

### Package: [name]
- Current: [version]
- Target: [version]
- Type: Security / Patch / Minor / Major

### Review
- [ ] Changelog reviewed for breaking changes
- [ ] Peer dependencies compatible
- [ ] No deprecation warnings affect our code

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript/linting passes
- [ ] Bundle size acceptable
- [ ] Manual verification of affected features

### Rollback
- Revert commit: `git revert [SHA]`
- Restore lockfile: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- package-lock.json && npm ci`
```

# Failure handling
- **Conflicting peer dependencies**: Check if other packages need updating together; may need to upgrade as a group
- **Tests fail after upgrade**: Read test output carefully—often the test needs updating, not the code
- **TypeScript errors**: Check if @types package needs separate update; may lag behind main package
- **Breaking change not in changelog**: Check GitHub issues and PRs for migration guidance; document what you learn
- **Lockfile merge conflicts**: Regenerate lockfile; never manually resolve lockfile conflicts
